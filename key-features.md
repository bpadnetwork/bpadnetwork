**Project Components**

BPAD is one of the first research-backed project ido launchpads. The platform offers **BPAD** token holders the opportunity to participate in IDOs as well as private fundraising rounds for promising projects.

**IDO Launchpad:** 

BPAD will incubate projects helping them with everything they need to succeed pre- and post-IDO. This includes marketing and audits from top auditors in the industry such as Certik.

A thorough vetting process of the listed projects helps inform our investors and give them confidence. This includes KYC, audits, locking liquidity with partners. BPAD will provide listed projects with access to their vast array of contacts and those of the advisory team, so they are not left behind even when the launchpad event is concluded. BPAD aims to maximize project success which also maximizes investors' returns.

**Protection of Investors:** 

As the DeFi market continues to blossom, weâ€™ve witnessed varying degrees of rug pull events, many of which have left the investing community in distress. At BPAD, investors are offered thoroughly  vetted projects which reduces the chances of scams or rug pull events happening.

The platform hopes to restore the confidence level of users as it works towards ensuring quality over quantity.

**Private Allocation:**

Not only will the platform allow users to take part in launchpad events, but it also will provide token holders with access to private & seed fundraising rounds. These exclusive rounds have historically been restricted  to those with deep pockets and/or the right connections.  


To reward the biggest token holders, the team will hold private allocation rounds for projects that may not launch on the Safe Launch platform but are cross-chain.

**Instant Use case:** 

Instead of waiting for projects to launch their products long after the conclusion of token sales, it often means waiting until the mainnet launch of such a platform. At BPAD, the process is different.   


Each project launched on the launchpad will have access to liquidity farming providing greater liquidity for projects and more leverage start or continuing building on their platform. This will provide a tremendous advantage over the competition and offer a win-win situation or all.

**Staking:**

As part of the project goals, STAKING will be live alongside the IDO launchpad to provide token holders passive income earning means.
