## Why BPAD?

BPAD is the best decentralized IDO platform for the Binance Smart Chain Network. BPAD will empower crypto projects with the ability to distribute tokens and increase liquidity. BPAD has found a solution to incentivize and reward all token holders in a way that is inclusive and with a low barrier to entry. The fundamental flaws of existing launchpads is that acquiring enough tokens to participate in the ecosystem is prohibitive, and even if you do hold the tokens, you are not guaranteed an allocation spot. They are based on a first come first serve basis where automated bots can fill the whitelist spots in a matter of seconds. BPAD is creating fair decentralized launches. The hallmark of the BPAD is a two-round system that makes every tier level guaranteed an allocation. There is no luck, and no lotteries, and no bots; only fair distributed rewards for all participants.
